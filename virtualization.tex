\chapter{Virtualization Technologies}
General introduction about virtualization. What types of virtualization we are going to talk in this thesis. Introduce LXC, KVM, Xen.
Write about the technical background behind all three.
specifically, LXC is an userspace wrapper over the linux containers facility merged into the Linux kernel.
The idea of KVM and its isolation benefits as it allows running individual kernels for the VMs.
The fundamental idea of para virtualization on which Xen is based on.

\section{Linux Containers}
Refer the notes and th eman pages of LXC for a solid technical discussion on LXC+ Containers

Add a block diagram that shows all the components used in the Linux Containers... cgroups, namespaces, individual filesystems etc..

\label{img_blockDia}
\end{figure}


Explain the block diagram in detail.

The device works in two modes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Solar Powered:
The device performs two tasks in solar powered mode. First, it supplies power to the circuit. Second, it charges the Li-Ion battery.
\item Battery Powered:
The circuit operates in battery powered mode whenever there is insufficient solar power. The circuit uses power from the Li-Ion battery in this mode.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Kernel based Virtual Machines (KVM)}
A good technical discussion on how KVM works ... Refer the papers that already did this .... Add more info. Google it.
Add a nice block diagram of KVM..

\end{figure}

As shown in Figure \ref{img_solarPowerCircuit}, Explain the block diagram in detail ..... As shown in Figure \ref{img_solarPowerCircuit}, 


Add more detailed tech discussions ... See anatomy of KVM, Developerworks article by Tim Jones ...

\section{Xen}

Same as the above two .. A good technical introduction, followed by a block diagram and more detailed explanation.
